<p>The turn of the year provides an appropriate opportunity to introduce the youngster of <a href="../#about"><strong>clue¬∑engineering</strong></a> - me! I am the third head in our team and have been working together with Christian and Dennis for half a year now. Therefore, I would like to tell you something about me, the work in our team as well as the experiences we have made on our journey so far.</p>

<h2 id="hi%21">Hi!</h2>

<p>If you haven't read the title yet, here's some new information for you: My name is Simon.
I am 23 years old and living my life as hard as you can imagine in these special times. I am basically all day at home jumping between working in the morning and gaming in the evening (I would say studying too, but let us be real). üòÅ</p>

<p><img src="../src/2020-welcome-simon.jpg" alt="Simon Frings Portrait Photo" style="max-width: 50%;float: right;margin: 0 0 10px 10px;"></p>

<p>After school, I started studying <strong>media informatics</strong> at the TH-K√∂ln. I didn't have much to do with computer science until then, but a broad interest in design and media developed in me, up to including game development. This is what pushed me to choose this study program and so far I'd say that it was the right choice for me.</p>

<p>I've ran into Christian in early 2020 and we had a quick talk about where we are in life and it quickly became clear that we share common interests. He introduced me to his business concept and one thing led to another. In the first instance, I started with an internship to get a feeling for ourselves and see if it was a good fit.</p>

<p>After a very short time, the combination of theory at university and the practical application at <strong>clue¬∑engineering</strong> awakened in me enthusiasm for software development. This was of course also reflected in the daily work, so that we can speak of a successful first 3 months.</p>

<p>Afterward, Christian and I jointly considered that a smooth transition from intern to working student would make sense for both sides. I became a regular part of <strong>clue¬∑engineering</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="fields-of-work">Fields of work</h2>

<p>My scope of work covers several areas. My primary work is to support Christian in software development. I often take over the daily maintenance of our projects, so that they are always up to date. But I am also involved in the development of completely new projects.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am the right man when it comes to the graphical presentation of our content.
I don't think one semester of design makes me an expert, that's why I'm always looking for improvement.</p>

<p>Whether it's videos for a release, social images for <a href="https://github.com/clue">our GitHub</a>, or the design of <a href="https://twitter.com/another_clue">our tweets</a>. Reality can be whatever I want.</p>

<h2 id="my-impact">My Impact</h2>

<p>I guess you can see the extent to which I have an impact on our business. 
I'm told I add a certain freshness to everything we do and that my understanding of facts is adapted to modernity, so we always keep up with the times.
And I supply enough memes to get through the day.</p>

<p>Besides, I try to approach things from different perspectives and I always keep the mood up by being the positive human being I am.</p>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>I don't know what's coming, I don't know where my path at <strong>clue¬∑engineering</strong> is going yet. We have a lot of plans and ideas for the future and I am excited to get back to work.</p>

<p>Is <strong>clue¬∑engineering</strong> my lifetime job?
This question will be answered at the earliest when I finish my studies. Until then, I enjoy the time and have fun.</p>

<p>See you around!</p>
