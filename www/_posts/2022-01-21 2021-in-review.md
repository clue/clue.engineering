Another year has passed, so itâ€™s time for our year in review! Let's take a look
at the major achievement we've made with an entirely new Framework X, preparing
ReactPHP for fibers and more. Happy new year to everybody and letâ€™s dive right
in for some of our highlights from 2021 and beyond! ðŸŽ‰

## Framework X

One of our most exciting projects in 2021 was by far the launch of
[Framework X](https://framework-x.org/)! This idea has been around for a few
years now, so we're super excited to finally pull this off.

* The main idea was to make building modern, async PHP web applications much
  easier. This way, everyone can use ReactPHP's full potential without having to
  deal with all the low-level details.

* In late April, we [launched Framework X in a closed beta](https://twitter.com/x_framework/status/1388147294575468549)
  with only sponsors having access. We used this time to polish the project
  before releasing it to the public and get some early insights from people
  believing in our vision.

* In November, we took the next step and
  [launched our public beta](https://twitter.com/x_framework/status/1463160480030146565).
  We used this state of the project to get in some early feedback and to help
  prioritize the next steps. Weâ€™re working on the project ever since and are
  more motivated than ever!

* There are still a number of things we would like to address before launching
  the first stable version of Framework X. What would *you* like to see?

Yes, naming is hard! We've discussed this in our team back and forth on how to
call this project before publishing it. We've set out to use "Framework X" as a
placeholder originally, but we've grown more accustomed to it ever since. I
wonder what the future might holdâ€¦

## ReactPHP

ReactPHP has evolved quite a lot in 2021!

* In early 2021, the [fibers RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fibers) has been
  submitted for inclusion in PHP. After its first announcement, we quickly saw
  the potential and have started working on a plan to implement them into the
  ReactPHP ecosystem.

* Throughout the first half of the year, we've done everything to make sure
  ReactPHP is ready for the inclusion of fibers. Therefore, we've gone through
  all our core components to get them ready to use an all-new default loop.

* In July, we've [celebrated ReactPHP's 9th birthday](https://twitter.com/another_clue/status/1414222824152178688)
  together with the launch of the new default loop! I think it's fair to say
  using ReactPHP has never been easier. See [release announcement](../2021/announcing-reactphp-default-loop)!

* In the second half of the year, we've done a number of smaller changes that
  cleaned up and simplified [ReactPHP's Socket and HTTP APIs](https://twitter.com/another_clue/status/1422901570988032001),
  all while sticking to our BC promise.

* In late November 2021 and after a lot of work, we were finally ready to
  welcome the new PHP 8.1 version. Just in time for this milestone, we've
  [released our new async package](https://twitter.com/reactphp/status/1464178890855833604)
  as a development version to take advantage of fibers and coroutines from the
  get-go.

In total, we've [published more than 25 releases for ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/changelog.html#2021)
in 2021 alone. And just looking at these highlights, it's interesting to see how
much all of this has helped shape ReactPHP!

## clueÂ·engineering

We're still a small team and as seen above, weâ€™ve invested quite some time
preparing everything for PHP 8.1 and the release of fibers. But there's moreâ€¦

* After discussing the consequences the fibers RFC has on the future of async
  PHP, we quickly realized the full potential but also noticed a lot of
  misunderstandings concerning the functionality and purpose of fibers. This is
  what got us to write our most successful blog post to date:
  [Fibers in PHP: A new opportunity for async PHP?](https://clue.engineering/2021/fibers-in-php)

* Around midyear, we wrote a little something: 3212 words and 24256 characters
  later, we published our first ever written article for the German
  [PHP Magazin](https://entwickler.de/magazine-ebooks/php-magazin/):
  Transforming our knowledge into a single article was quite the experience.
  And even with these many pages, we feel weâ€™re barely scratching the surface!
  Read here (German): [Async PHP mit ReactPHP](https://entwickler.de/php/async-php-mit-reactphp)

* At the end of the year 2021, our team member and friend Dennis left the
  company after two years to seek new adventures. Weâ€™re thankful for the amazing
  time we've had together and wish you all the luck in the world for the new
  challenges youâ€™re going to face. Goodbye Dennis!

## Looking forward

After looking back at what happened last year, let's talk about our plans for 2022:

* Perhaps most importantly, we want to publish Framework X as a stable release
  as soon as possible. We already have a lot of new features and improvements on
  our list and weâ€™re still deciding what needs to be in X to call it a stable
  version. If thereâ€™s anything youâ€™d like to see,
  [your suggestions](https://github.com/clue/framework-x/discussions) are more
  than welcome!

* Next to this, we're continuing our work on ReactPHP's new async package to
  bring fibers to the masses! Weâ€™re not too far from a stable version and our
  APIs are shaping up nicely.

* Speaking of which: This year also marks ReactPHP's 10th anniversary! Feels
  like it's a good time to shape up ReactPHP for years to come!

* Trying hard not to tease too much, but there are even more exciting projects
  coming up! This probably deserves its own blog post, so watch out, we'll keep
  you posted.

Thank you all for your support and cheers to an awesome 2022! ðŸ¥³
