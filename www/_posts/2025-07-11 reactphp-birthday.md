![ReactPHP â€“ 13 years](../src/2025-reactphp-birthday.png)

**Thirteen years ago, ReactPHP emerged into the world, and now it's officially a teenager!**

Like any 13-year-old, ReactPHP has grown more independent and learned to handle complex async operations with ease. It's reached that age where it can stay up all night handling streams without its parents worrying.

Sure, v3 is still somewhere on the horizon, but honestly? Thirteen years of reliable async operations speaks for itself. Yes, v3 is still [in the works](https://github.com/orgs/reactphp/discussions/481) - just need to carve out time to [make it happen](https://github.com/sponsors/reactphp). When v3 lands, it's going to be *awesome*!

At 13, ReactPHP definitely knows its way around non-blocking I/O. It can handle streams all day without breaking a sweat, and let's face it - once you go async, synchronous code just feels... slow.

For those of us who've been building with ReactPHP over the years, it's been pretty amazing to watch it mature. From those early experiments with event loops to the robust ecosystem we have today - it's come [a long way](https://reactphp.org/changelog.html).

Here's to 13 years of ReactPHP and all the amazing projects it's enabled. Can't wait to see what the next phase brings!

Happy birthday, ReactPHP! ðŸš€

*P.S. - We promise we won't ground you if v3 takes a bit longer. Growing up is hard, even for PHP libraries.*
